# CoreLink

## The Secure AI Access Layer for Your Workspace

---

## 1. Vision

CoreLink is a local AI access layer that allows AI agents to safely interact with your digital workspace — without giving them unrestricted access or locking you into a single service provider.

It sits between:

* AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, local agents)
* Your workspace (email, calendar, tasks, notes)

CoreLink enforces:

* What AI can read
* What AI can write
* Which service provider executes the action

It does not attempt to prevent manual copy/paste misuse.
It governs structured AI access.

---

## 2. Core Problem

As AI assistants gain deeper integrations, users face two issues:

1. **Unrestricted Access**
   Connecting AI directly to Gmail or other apps gives broad, opaque access.

2. **Vendor Lock-In**
   AI workflows become tightly coupled to specific providers (e.g., Gmail vs Outlook).

Users want AI productivity — without losing control or flexibility.

---

## 3. Product Architecture (Hybrid Model)

### A) Local Data Plane (Open Source)

Runs on the user’s machine.

Responsibilities:

* Stores OAuth tokens locally (encrypted)
* Connects to workspace apps (Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
* Acts as MCP-compatible gateway for AI agents
* Proxies structured AI requests
* Applies access control policies
* Logs all AI-driven data access and actions

Raw content is processed locally before AI receives it.

The cloud never sees unfiltered workspace data.

---

### B) Cloud Control Plane (Paid – Business Tier)

Optional SaaS layer providing:

* Team policy management
* Role-based access control
* Organization-wide rule templates
* Aggregated metadata dashboards
* Compliance-friendly audit exports
* Policy sync across devices

It does not process raw content by default.

---

## 4. Core Features (V1)

### 1️⃣ Access Control (Security)

AI can:

* Access specific folders only
* Be blocked from certain senders/domains
* Exclude labeled emails
* Be limited to specific data scopes

Optional:

* Approval mode for sensitive requests
* Clear audit log of AI activity

This governs structured AI integrations, not manual user behavior.

---

### 2️⃣ Service Abstraction

AI interacts with generic actions:

* `list_emails()`
* `send_email()`
* `create_task()`
* `create_event()`

CoreLink maps these actions to:

* Gmail or Outlook
* Todoist or Microsoft To Do
* Other providers in future

AI workflows are decoupled from specific vendors.

Users can switch providers without rewriting AI logic.

---

## 5. What CoreLink Is NOT

* Not an OS security agent
* Not a runtime sandbox
* Not a full prevention system
* Not a compliance enforcement tool (v1)
* Not a workflow automation engine

It is an AI access governance layer.

---

## 6. V1 Scope (Disciplined)

Initial focus:

* Gmail connector
* OpenAI proxy or MCP integration
* Deterministic rules (folders, senders, labels)
* Clear audit log
* Local-first architecture

No:

* Semantic embeddings
* Complex routing
* Multi-service orchestration
* Advanced team governance

---

## 7. V2 Expansion: Routing

Future enhancement:

Smart dispatch rules such as:

* Personal tasks → Todoist
* Work tasks → Microsoft To Do
* Client emails → Outlook
* Internal emails → Gmail

AI remains provider-agnostic.
CoreLink resolves execution.

---

## 8. Target Users (V1)

* AI-heavy solo founders
* Consultants and agencies
* Developers integrating AI with their workspace

Users who:

* Want deeper AI integration
* Care about controlled access
* Want portability across services

---

## 9. Core Value Proposition

Without CoreLink:

* AI connects directly to providers.
* Access scope is broad.
* No unified policy.
* Vendor coupling increases.
* Limited visibility.

With CoreLink:

* AI integrates once.
* Access is governed locally.
* Providers are abstracted.
* Actions are logged.
* Switching services is easier.

CoreLink makes AI integrations safer and portable.

---

## 10. Strategic Positioning

CoreLink is:

> The local access layer between AI agents and your digital workspace.

It is not about preventing every possible misuse.

It is about governing structured AI access with clarity and control.
